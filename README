Auth request module for nginx.

This module allows authorization based on subrequest result.  Once subrequest
returns 2xx status - access is allowed, on 401 or 403 - disabled with
appropriate status.  Anything else is considered to be an error.

For 401 status WWW-Authenticate header from subrequest response will be
passed to client.

Module works at access phase and therefore may be combined nicely with other
access modules (access, auth_basic) via satisfy directive.

Configuration directives:

    auth_request <uri>|off

        Context: http, server, location
        Default: off

        Switches auth request module on and sets uri which will be asked for
        authorization.

Usage:

    location /private/ {
        auth_request /auth;
        ...
    }

    location = /auth {
        proxy_pass ...
    }

To compile nginx with auth request module, use "--add-module <path>" option
to nginx configure.

Development of this module was sponsored by Openstat (http://www.openstat.com/).
